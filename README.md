# Spirit-Vein-Cultivation
This is a rendition of the "game" the MC plays in the story "A Spirit Vein's Guide to Immortality" by TrueDawn on Royal Road.  Found Here: https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49668/a-spirit-veins-guide-to-immortality

## TODO:
### Planned for this Branch:
- Skills display and upgrading
- Spirit Accumulation Module
- Modified gain rate of higher tier resources
- Determine y/n to subsections for upgrade module

### Additions:
- Add Skills to Upgrade Module
- Create Inspection display (displays details gained via the "Inspect" function)
- Text Log for displaying updates, e.g. "Quest Unlocks" or other such things
- QUESTS: Entire thing needs to be implemented!
- "Spirit Accumulation Module" needs to be implemented
- "Character Size" needs to be added and utilized!  Research into what it actually changes too!

### Changes: 
- Gain Rate of higher tier resources needs to be modified, either the time taken or amount gained, or both
- Maybe make the Upgrade Module have subsections that are hidden by default (Skills, Stats, etc.) instead of all on/off
- All of the Art and Graphics need to be modified and updated to something properly usable.
