# Spirit-Vein-Cultivation
## Inspiration:
This is a rendition of the "game" the MC plays in the story "A Spirit Vein's Guide to Immortality" by TrueDawn on Royal Road.  Found Here: https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49668/a-spirit-veins-guide-to-immortality

## Play
You can play here: https://tvoids.github.io/Spirit-Vein-Cultivation/HTML/index.html
Please note that this is without ANY of the assets, so it doesn't really work perfectly.  Lots of no-image marks...

## Setup/Install:
To setup this game, you'll likely have to find assets that you like to represent all the buttons.  Later I might make custom buttons to avoid this restriction, but GameDev market resources are to be used in projects, but not in a way that is easily isolated (hide the images in some way really)
Otherwise, just download the entire project and run the index.html
It should work, but the buttons won't appear

## TODO:
### Planned for SOON(TM):
- Quests
- Spirit Receptor Module (v1c18)


### Additions:
- QUESTS: Entire thing needs to be implemented!
- "Spirit Receptor Module" needs to be implemented
- Knowledge Module! (This is not going to be anytime soon)
- "Character Size" needs to be added and utilized!  Research into what it actually changes too!

### Changes: 
- Maybe make the Upgrade Module have subsections that are hidden by default (Skills, Stats, etc.) instead of all on/off
- All of the Art and Graphics need to be modified and updated to something properly usable.

### Potential Additions:
- More skills!
- "Users" who are using your Spirit Aura to cultivate
- "Total Produced" and "Total Used by Cultivators" to show how much of your produced resources have been picked up and used by cultivators
