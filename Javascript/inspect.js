At this point, multiple people, especially alchemists and gardeners, would totally love to have Superior Spirit Slag on hand. Why, you might ask? Well, Superior Spirit Slag is actually closer to Spirit Stones compared to actual Spirit Slag. Sure, it's packaged the same way as the two previous products and has even better smelling perfume, but its effects are leagues apart compared to its previous variant.  Surprisingly, it's also used to cure hemorrhoids."
